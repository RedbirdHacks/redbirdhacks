          <h3>What is RedbirdHacks?</h3>
          <p>RedbirdHacks is ISU's first hackathon for students to prototype, program, and pitch their ideas to corporate sponsors in an entrepreneurial fashion, connecting Arts Technology, Information Technology, and Business students to cultivate innovation and collaboration to empower all students.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col33">
          <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
          <p>Hackathons are 24-36 hour programming competitions where students prototype their ideas and pitch them to corporate sponsors in an entrepreneurial fashion. Hackathons began in the mid 2000s as ways to quickly develop software ideas for corporations and venture capitalists and quickly branched to create university hackathons.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col33">
          <h3>What can I make?</h3>
          <p>Anything you can come up with! You have 36 hours to make anything from websites, desktop apps, mobile apps, or even traditional software.  All coding must be done during the hackathon, but feel free to use APIs and open source libraries. If you hack it, we will judge it based on creativity, technical difficulty, usefulness, and overall awesomeness.<p/>
