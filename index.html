			</div>
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>Who can participate in RedbirdHacks?</h3>
				<p>All undergraduate students from any university are welcome. Non-ISU students must be 18 or older and enrolled in an accredited college or university. If you do not fit in this category, feel free to contact us.<p/>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>What kind of skill set is required?</h3>
				<p>Students of all majors are welcome regardless of skills. Just come with a willingness to learn something new!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>What can I build?</h3>
				<p>Anything you can come up with! You have 36 hours to make anything, ranging from web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, or even traditional software. If you hack it, we will judge it. Legality and safety are your only bounds.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>Bring your student ID for admission (name must match registration). You are also responsible for bringing all of your passion, keyboard, mouse, laptop, other necessary hardware, software, or any other items you would need within a 36 hour time frame. Don't forget your chargers!

			<div class="col33">
				<h3>What if I don't have an idea?</h3>
				<p>No problem! Many hackers arrive at a hackathon with little to no idea of what they'll be building over the next 36 hours. Check out our API expo to see what's available to you as a result of our sponsors and talk to your team. Aim for a prize, or don't. Totally up to you.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col33">

				<h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
				<p>Yes. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and plenty of drinks will be provided throughout the competition at no cost to participants. We will be providing vegetarian and vegan options as well. If you have any other dietary restrictions, please email us and we'll take care of you!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>Are we allowed to build on past projects?</h3>
				<p>A hackathon is an chance to build on something completely new within a set amount of time. With that in mind, you cannot work on past projects. If you want to prepare for the hackathon, focus on gaining experience with and knowledge of the tools you hope to use to build your application.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col33">
				<h3>What are the team sizes? Can I hack alone?</h3>
				<p>You can work alone but, we highly encourage you to build with a team. Teams should be at most 4 people.</p>
